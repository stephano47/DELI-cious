    // File Writer should be working the moment the user makes the new order
    // It will first get the bread then the size.
    // The regular toppings next but the question is how can I allow the writer to put more than one topping in the same text.
    // I realised im thinking of this as a csv file this is not what we are doing it will be a txt file at the end.
    //The premium topping should first be considered a boolean if the user would like meats and/or cheese it calls the premium method.
    //If premium is chosen they will cost more and there are extra options (extra can be a boolean).
    // If not it is considered false and will print out "None" or maybe just not have it there at all so return null perhaps.
    // after the toppings are chosen by the user it will then ask for toasted option if no it will return null if yes then the console will printout Toasted or (T)
    // after that return to the Order loop.
    //Since the Drinks and Chips method would be very similar to the sandwich method some majority of the code could be pasted in those classes
    // When the user is ready for checkout the file reader shows what they will order.
    // A simple boolean for Y/N will be good enough
    // Then it goes back to the main loop and do it all over again if needed.

    /*Goals
    Make FileWriter
    Make FileReader as well
    Perhaps can use if statements for specific outcomes examples as in a large sandwich with premium toppings
